    "description": "Greetings, Esteemed Hydrators of the Universe,\n\nThe task before us may appear humble, but its implications are monumental. I present to you a container, a vessel, a chalice—commonly known as a \"glass\"—filled to the brim with nature's finest: water.\n\nJust as WebXR explores realms beyond 2D boundaries, so does the act of drinking water nourish beyond mere physical sustenance. It revitalizes mind, body, and soul. A simple sip is a step, nay, a leap, into a new frontier of well-being.\n\n1. **Grip the Reality**: Take hold of the glass. Feel its weight—this is the gravity of your mission. You're not merely lifting a glass; you are taking hold of a lifeline. As your fingers wrap around it, consider this your first handshake with vitality.\n\n2. **Elevation is Key**: With the same audacity that took us to the moon, raise the glass towards your lips. Gravity may pull it down, but your spirit, my fellow hydrators, will lift it up.\n\n3. **Pause for Democracy**: Before you sip, take a moment to appreciate the freedom in your choice. Much like a voter in a booth or a coder before a keyboard, this is your moment of power. Exercise it wisely.\n\n4. **The Inauguration**: As the water meets your lips, let it cascade with grace and dignity onto your waiting palate. This is not merely a sip; it's the ceremonial ushering in of a hydrated new era.\n\n5. **Executive Function**: Swallow. Feel the water's journey, much like our nation's history, from aspiration to realization. It travels down, a liquid interstate of unity, contributing to the greater good of the body. You have just ratified your own personal constitution of health.\n\n6. **The Future is Now**: Place the glass back on the table. Let it rest, but know that this is not the end. Like our enduring Republic, it stands ready for the next cycle of renewal and refreshment.\n\nAnd so, my fellow humans, you have completed an act simple in mechanics but profound in meaning. You've turned the act of drinking water into a symphony of purpose and a dance of existence.\n\nStay thirsty for greatness, but never for water.\n"

I have collected some bits and pieces of my creative and research works.\n\n---\nIf you interested in production background, more info:\n\nFact Sheet: European Year of Equal Opportunities for All\nThe European Commission has designated 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. The aim is to promote the rights of everyone to equal treatment and a life free of discrimination, and to draw attention to the benefits of diversity. The European Union has already adopted far-reaching legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age, disability and sexual orientation. In 2003, the European Commission launched the five-year campaign \"For Diversity, Against Discrimination\". The Year will introduce a bolder strategy and give further momentum to the EU-wide fight against discrimination with a year-long series of events and activities taking place both nationally and on a pan-European level. The launch of the Year will take place in Berlin on 30 January 2007 under the auspices of the German EU Presidency.\nAims:In 2000, the European Union adopted two very wide-ranging laws to prohibit discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. However, calling for equal rights and adopting laws to try and guarantee them is not enough to ensure that equal opportunities are enjoyed by everyone in practice. The benefits of diversity have to be shown to bring about a change in behaviour. The Year will promote equal opportunities and raise awareness about the rights of everyone to equal treatment, and the benefits of diversity. Non-discrimination is not only a moral argument -- diversity also makes economic sense. The Year will promote the benefits of diversity and establish that to benefit from the full wealth of skills, talent and ideas it is vital that everyone is included.\nThematic Focus:\nActivities will need to provide a balanced treatment of all grounds of discrimination that are addressed at EU level (gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation). In addition activities must be balanced in promoting the four designated objectives of the Year: \nRights (raising awareness about and protecting rights) \nRepresentation (promoting the participation of all groups in society) \n\n\n---\n\nFlaboy.com Ltd\n"

So you create the path, then you add taper and bevel objects, then you create a timeline animation changing bevel the end and the start position, do not forget to check the mapping. Then you add f-curve cycle modifier and create collection for particle emmiter, then you need a force field to blow all the particles into magical herd of coronavirus immuned jellyfish-like in-out creatures. BTW. if you are interested in science - a herd immunity will bevenr higher than 20% for any of coronaviruses - there are plenty of them and they are everywhere, do the covid test to your dog and send it to NHS. So if g-o-v want to play this sh1tshow it will prove longer they will prove that society in general is ready for depopulation. Sad true. I hope you will like my short animation. gotta go, cya.\n"

Recently, life took an unexpected turn as I found myself laid off from my job at Samsung Electronics. In the face of challenges, I've decided to channel my energy into something incredibly exciting and innovative – building an open web metaverse known as YOLO.CX.\n\nImagine a real-time 3D world where you can connect with friends and family seamlessly, regardless of where they are. YOLO.CX is more than just a project; it's a vision for a space where people can come together, share experiences, and create memories in a whole new way.\n\nHowever, turning this vision into reality requires resources, and that's where I could use your support. The funds raised will be dedicated to crucial elements like hosting, storage, and a fast real-time database with a websocket solution. To ensure a smooth experience, we need to implement a cluster of at least 6 instances, which, as you can imagine, comes with a monthly cost that jumps from £50 to a few hundred pounds.\n\nHere's where you come in – by supporting this crowdfunding campaign, you're not just helping me bring YOLO.CX to life; you're becoming a part of something groundbreaking. And I want to make it extra special for those who contribute.\n\nWhy should you join us?\n\nBe among the first citizens of YOLO.CX!\nShape the early stages of the metaverse and witness its growth.\nPlay a crucial role in fostering innovation and connection in the digital realm.\n\nI'm asking for your support, no matter how big or small, to make YOLO.CX a reality. Together, we can create a space that goes beyond the ordinary and explores new frontiers on the open web.\n\nReady to embark on this journey with me? Contribute and be part of the YOLO.CX community.\nThank you for being a part of this adventure!\n\nCheers,\nSylwester\n"
